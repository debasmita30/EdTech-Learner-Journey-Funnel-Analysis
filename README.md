## Data-Driven Insights into Learner Behavior and Course Selection

Analyzed a large-scale behavioral dataset to model the online learner journey, identify key drop-off points in the enrollment funnel, and provide data-driven recommendations to increase student conversion. This project demonstrates end-to-end BI skills from data cleaning (ETL) to interactive dashboarding and insight generation.

Key Features & Analysis
ETL Process: Cleaned and transformed over 2.7 million event records using Power Query, including converting Unix timestamps to a usable DateTime format.

Funnel Visualization: Created an interactive funnel chart in Power BI to visualize the learner journey from Course View → Expressed Interest → Successful Enrollment.

DAX Measures: Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX, such as:

Distinct Learner Counts at each stage.

Stage-by-stage Conversion Rates.

Overall Enrollment Rate.

Actionable Recommendations: Translated data insights into clear business recommendations aimed at improving user experience and increasing enrollment.

Technical Skills & Tools
BI Tool: Microsoft Power BI

Data Transformation: Power Query

Data Modeling & Analysis: DAX

Key Business Insights
Critical Drop-off Identified: The analysis revealed a major drop-off point between learners viewing a course and showing active interest (e.g., saving a course).

Recommendation: Enhance course pages with more engaging content like career outcome statistics and student testimonials to improve the value proposition and drive interest.

High Intent from Engaged Users: Learners who expressed interest (e.g., added a course to a cart) converted to enrollment at a significantly higher rate, identifying them as a high-intent audience.

Recommendation: Implement targeted email nurturing campaigns for this segment to guide them toward enrollment and reduce churn.
